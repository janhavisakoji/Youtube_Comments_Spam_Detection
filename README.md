# Youtube_Comments_Spam_Detection
This project detects spam vs non-spam comments from YouTube datasets using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
It compares models trained on TF-IDF features and Word2Vec embeddings.

ðŸš€ # Project Overview

Dataset: UCI YouTube Spam Collection Dataset

Goal: Build and compare ML models to detect spam comments.

Techniques Used:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (NLTK, regex, stopwords, lemmatization)

Feature Engineering: TF-IDF & Word2Vec

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost

Model Comparison with Accuracy & Classification Reports

Visualizations: WordCloud, Countplots, Accuracy Comparison

ðŸ“‚ # Dataset

The dataset contains comments from 5 popular YouTube videos (Psy, Katy Perry, LMFAO, Eminem, Shakira).

Each comment is labeled as:

1 = Spam

0 = Non-Spam (Ham)
